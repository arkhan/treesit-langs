# `update = none` makes `git submodule update` a no-op. This prevents wasteful work on e.g. MELPA.
# Checkouts can be done explicitly with `git submodule update --checkout`.

# `ignore = dirty` makes `git status` ignore untracked files and uncommited changes in submodules.
# This reduces noises when working on the grammars.
